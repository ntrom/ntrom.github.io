    <h4>Tips for Engaging Conversation with Software Engineering Talent</h4>
    <p>In a world where software has become essential, finding a good software developer can be competitive. Like programming itself, there are many ways to acheive success,
       so programmers are often looking for the right fit, which is usually more than just finding a match for technical skills. Here are some tips that I would recommend for someone reaching out
       to a developer like myself.

            <strong>Including the company name</strong>
            <p>Knowing the name of the company is an essential part of wanting to engage in a conversation. While it makes sense for third-party recruiters to reach out and network either way, from the developer's perspective, we want to be informed of who we would ultimately be working for, in the interest of both of our time.</p>

            <strong>Mentioning the industry/business the software will service</strong>
            <p>
                Since software developers typically work for several different types of companies over the course of their career,
                we are often primarily interested in what business your company is in, to help determine if this is an area of interest.
                Including this is especially important if you do not include the company name.

            <strong>Highlighting whether the role focuses more on new feature/product development or maintenance of existing products</strong>
            <p>
                It is helpful to know whether the company is at a point where they need someone to deliver an entirely new system, vs maintaining an existing one.
                I am particularly excited to build a new system for your company, or to
                come in to do a security analysis for your existing product, and perpetually find security bugs as they arise.

            <strong>Refraining from Commands</strong>
            <p>
                It is ideal to refrain from imperative statements, because they sometimes can make the reader feel like they are being commanded.
                For example, "Send me your availability" is not as polite and appreciated as "Would you be able to tell me a few days/times you are available?".

            <strong>Avoiding file transfer, until necessary / farther along in the process</strong>
            <p>
                It is best to avoid transferring files between recruiters and candidates, until a relationship has been established, for the sake of both parties' security. Sending someone a file and asking (or commanding)
                them to open it is a social engineering tactic that can lead to the spread of malware.
