    <h3>Bug Knowledge Base</h3>

    <p>This is a knowledge base of my experience with finding bugs in software.</p>

    <h3>Common Types of Vulnerabilities</h3>
    <p>Here are some common types of vulnerabilities, which I especially focus on finding in existing systems, and strive to avoid creating in code that I author.</p>

    <h4>Path Traversal Vulnerabilities</h4>
    <p>If a web application has functionality that reads files from disk, where the file path is built from variables that can contain user input, it is possible that a Path Traversal vulnerability could exist, allowing one to traverse the file system and obtain arbitrary files - if not handled carefully.</p>

    <h4>Insecure Direct Object References (IDORs)</h4>
    <p>
        If a web application has an endpoint that accepts an arbitrary identifier, and does not correctly protect access to the corresponding record(s), it could be a case of an IDOR.

    </p>

    <h4>Race Conditions</h4>
    <p>
        Since web applications are concurrent systems, often with high complexity, it can be difficult to always correctly manage concurrency.
        Race conditions can exist that allow exposure of sensitive data, or performing a write that would otherwise not be allowed under normal circumstances.
    </p>

    <h4>SQL injections</h4>
    <p>
        Many web applications use SQL databases as the underlying technology for persisting structured records.
        If the application code contains any instances where, the SQL text is concatenated with variables that can contain user input - it is possible that the user can inject arbitrary SQL syntax in a way unintended by the developers, potentially allowing for exfiltration of more of the database than intended (or all of it).
    </p>


    <h4>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h4>
    <p>
        XSS vulnerabilities come from web applications that do not sanitize user input for front-end scripts, which if exploited, would allow the user to either view (reflected XSS) the results directly, or (stored XSS) cause the system to persist javascript to a record that gets rendered at a later time for potentially another user, allowing the XSS author to potentially execute arbitrary javascript on behalf of other users. This in itself has an array of implications.
    </p>

    <h4>Same-Site and Cross-Site Request Forgery (SSRF and CSRF)</h4>
    <p>
        SSRF and CSRF vulnerabilities come from web application endpoints that do not ensure the caller has a means of secondarily verifying who it is, among from a token in a cookie, allowing for potential cookie stealing and account takeover if not handled correctly.
