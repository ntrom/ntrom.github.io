    <h3>Tools of the Trade</h3>

    <p>
        Getting into programming huh? Or, seasoned expert? Alright cool, well either way, I'd love to show ya a list of tools, technologies, languages, and more, that have made my life as a programmer what it is today.
    </p>

    <h4>Compilers and Programming Languages</h4>
    <p>
        The underlying systems that allows programmers to operate on a logical level (vs. a physical/machine-driven level) are
        programming languages, and their corresponding tools called <strong>compilers</strong>, which translate the logical declaration of operations
        into a sequence of machine instructions that perform the underlying low-level mathematical operations.

    <h4>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</h4>
    <p>
        IDEs are the tool a programmer lives in every day. It contains compilers, text editors with syntax coloring, and many other features that facilitate rapid development. Of course, you can always code without an IDE at the end of the day (compiling on the command line), but using an IDE is the most effective and efficient way to stay productive.
