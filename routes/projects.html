        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout my career, I've been a product-focused engineer developing new
            features, systems, and databases for line-of-business web applications.
            Here you'll find a description of the various projects I've worked on in
            my career.
        </p>

        <div>
            <h4>Glass Manufacturing Quality Control - Web Application / Database</h4>
            <p>
                <div>
                    <small>Made with: </small>
                    <span class="badge">C#</span>
                    <span class="badge">Nancy</span>
                    <span class="badge">MongoDB</span>
                    <span class="badge">HTML</span>
                    <span class="badge">Vue.js</span>
                    <span class="badge">Bootstrap</span>
                </div>
                One of my most significant projects was with a company that makes hardware and software used for glass manufacturing and inspection.
                I single-handedly built an entire database and web application that display and persist the results of glass inspections.

        <div>
            <h4>Glass Manufacturing Quality Control - 3D Rendering</h4>
            <p>
                <div>
                    <small>Made with: </small>
                    <span class="badge">Three.js</span>
                    <span class="badge">Blender</span>
                </div>
                An exciting project I developed for the glass company involved 3D modeling and rendering. This was a significant experience
                for me because it strengthened my skills with texture mapping - a skill particularly useful for 3D game development.

        <div>
            <h4>Residential Management Web Application</h4>
            <p>
                <div>
                    <small>Made with: </small>
                    <span class="badge">C#</span>
                    <span class="badge">ASP.NET MVC</span>

                    <span class="badge">HTML</span>
                    <span class="badge">AngularJS</span>
                    <span class="badge">Bootstrap</span>
                </div>
                For five years, I was a lead full-stack engineer at a company that offers software
                and professional services for the residential management industry. I built a large
                amount of the application, and designed much of its framework and architecture.
                This project was the largest and most significant experience of my career to date.

        <div>
            <h4>Residential Management Auth Database</h4>
            <p>
                <div>
                    <small>Made with: </small>
                    <span class="badge">SQL Server</span>
                </div>
                Another core project I developed for the residential management company was a central database
                for authentication and authorization of users. This was designed to be utilized by the other
                apps within the company, as a means of facilitating single sign-on.

        <div>
            <h4>Resident Portal Web Application</h4>
            <p>
                <div>
                    <small>Made with: </small>
                    <span class="badge">C#</span>

                    <span class="badge">Bootstrap</span>
                </div>
                In addition to the main web app, I was also a primary developer
                of a resident portal application, which the management companies offer as a service for their residents.

        <p>Check out some of my personal projects I'm currently working on.</p>

        <div>
            <h4>Game Engine</h4>
            <div>
                <small>Made with: </small>
                <span class="badge">C++</span>
                <span class="badge">OpenGL</span>
            </div>
            <p>Over the years, I've been building a game engine for 2D and 3D games.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Game Asset Database / Web Application</h4>
            <div>
                <small>Made with: </small>
                <span class="badge">C#</span>

                <span class="badge">React</span>
            </div>
            <p>
                Associated with the game engine, yet independently functional, I've been building an application/database for managing game assets.
                This includes a custom build process/pipeline for optimized resource loading in the engine. I'm currently working on preparing it
                for concurrent usage, to facilitate remote game project collaboration with my friends and colleagues.

            </div>
            <p>
                I developed an application for myself that I use to keep track of my finances. It is very rewarding to build something useful for yourself!

            <p>
                Another fun personal project of mine is a home IoT (internet of things) platform, for Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
                I developed a few software modules for working with electronic components (i.e. 4-digit 7-segment LED displays) as well
                as a means of remotely interacting with the devices through the network.

        <p>
            Here you'll find some of the projects I developed during my time at Stony Brook University.
        </p>

        <div>
            <h4>Lotus Field</h4>
            <div>
                <small>Made with: </small>
                <span class="badge">C#</span>
                <span class="badge">XNA (ported to MonoGame)</span>
            </div>
            <p>Lotus Field is a game project developed by myself, two other programmers, and an artist. It was a game that used concepts of music to represent harmony and dissonance within a colony of underwater creatures.</p>

            <h4>Volume Revolution</h4>
            <div>
                <small>Made with: </small>
                <span class="badge">C++</span>
                <span class="badge">DirectX</span>
            </div>
            <p>Volume Revolution is a game project developed by myself, and two other programmers. I came up with the idea after years of playing guitar and always feeling like I had to worry about the volume. The main character is modeled after myself,
            and the objective of the game is to make it through the levels using your guitar to blast soundwaves at enemies and obstacles. Each level has a musical key signature, made of color-coded chords that the player collects to get through the level.
            This project was a winner of the annual SBU Game Programming Competition.</p>

            <p>Corey Conundrum is a 3D game project about drums. I built this project myself, focusing heavily on learning the Unity game engine.</p>
