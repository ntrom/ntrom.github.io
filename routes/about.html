            <p class="card-text">
                I've been professionally developing full-stack web applications for over seven years. I found that full-stack roles are a great fit for me,
                as I enjoy building entire features/systems, from the data structure all the way to the user interface.

                As a full-stack developer with a bit of an emphasis on the back end, I've had significant experience with databases. I've written and
                optimized a large number of complex queries/commands, and am very comfortable designing and maintaining schemas.

                I focused heavily on game development at SBU, and continue to advance this
